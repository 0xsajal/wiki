## Introduction

Edge provides infrastructure for application-specific chains that operate with [PolyBFT consensus](/docs/cdk/edge/design/consensus/polybft/overview.md). It leverages a [native bridge](/docs/cdk/edge/design/bridge/overview.md) to connect with an associated rootchain, enabling Edge-powered chains to inherit its security and capabilities. Additionally, Edge extend the block space available on the rootchain, providing scalability and interoperability for decentralized applications. With on-chain governance mechanisms, Edge empower communities to make decisions and upgrade the network in a transparent and compliant manner.

The following table offers a comprehensive overview on what Edge-powered chains are through different perspectives.

| Edge-powered chains are | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Application-specific blockchain networks designed for specific use cases. | Appchains are customizable blockchain networks that developers can tailor to meet specific enterprise or application use cases. With appchains, developers can create high-performance blockchain networks that are fast and low-cost. |
| Modular and complex-minimized blockchain development. | Edge offer a modular framework that simplifies blockchain development, providing developers with the tools necessary to create customizable blockchain networks that are scalable, secure, and interoperable. Developers can use the Edge stack to create high-performance blockchain networks with advanced capabilities without worrying about complex integrations or intermediaries. |
| Customizable blockchain networks for reliable business logic. | A customizable virtual machine provides full Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support out of the box, enabling developers to tailor the virtual machine to their specific needs and requirements. This feature includes customizing gas limits, adding new opcodes, and integrating with other technologies. |
| Interoperable and multi-chain driven | A native bridging solution enables the seamless transfer of assets from various EVM-compatible blockchains back to the Polygon ecosystem. This bridging solution allows developers to customize bridge plugins to meet specific requirements, facilitating interoperability between blockchains and different layers. |

The diagram above demonstrates how Edge-powered chains are interconnected with the Polygon PoS network, which benefits from the security properties of Ethereum. By leveraging blockchain technology, Edge provide a strong foundation for building decentralized and blockchain-based solutions that can withstand adversarial conditions, resist censorship, and scale to meet the increasing demand for processing power, data storage, and transaction throughput.

Edge employs a multi-faceted approach that leverages a combination of complementary scaling solutions to achieve maximum scalability. These solutions include layer-2 scaling techniques, parallelization, and, eventually, ZK technology.

By integrating these methods, Edge can efficiently accommodate the increasing demand for processing power, data storage, and transaction throughput as the number of users and applications on the network grows.
