Crossmint is the leading enterprise-grade web3 development platform, allowing you to build NFT applications without requiring any blockchain experience or holding cryptocurrency, and making the blockchain invisible to end users. The platform offers a one-stop-shop for most of your NFT infrastructure needs across all major chains, including creating, distributing, selling, storing digital assets, and offering post-mint utility. 

To create a new smart contract using Crossmint's Developer Console, follow the steps below.
> Crossmint has two Developer Console environments, they are, **Staging** which works with contracts deployed on a Testnet and **Production** which works with contracts deployed on a Mainnet. Please use the Staging environment to familiarize yourself with Crossmint before proceeding with the Production environment. 

1. Navigate to the [Crossmint's Developer Console page:](https://staging.crossmint.com/console/overview/?utm_source=backlinks)
